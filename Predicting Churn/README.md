ABOUT PROJECT.

This is a private hackathon open to Data Science Nigeria (DSN) 
Pre-Bootcamp hackathon participants. 

Expresso is an African telecommunications company that provides 
customers with airtime and mobile data bundles. The objective of 
this challenge is to develop a machine learning model to predict
 the likelihood of each Expresso customer “churning,” i.e. becoming 
inactive and not making any transactions for 90 days.

This solution will help Expresso to better serve their customers 
by understanding which customers are at risk of leaving.

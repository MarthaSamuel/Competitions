ABOUT PROJECT.

Kowope Mart is a Nigerian-based retail company with a vision to 
provide quality goods, education and automobile services to its 
customers at affordable price and reduce if not eradicate charges 
on card payments and increase customer satisfaction with credit 
rewards that can be used within the Mall. To achieve this, the 
company has partnered with DSBank on co-branded credit card with 
additional functionality such that customers can request for loan, 
pay for goods even with zero-balance and then pay back within an 
agreed period of time. This innovative strategy has increased sales 
for the company. However, there has been recent cases of credit 
defaults and Kowope Mart will like to have a system that profiles 
customers who are worthy of the card with minimum if not zero risk 
of defaulting.

You have been employed as a Data Scientist to leverage Machine 
learning to predict customers who are likely to default or not.
